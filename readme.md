## Repo for my twitteraccount with Eredivisie plots 

Current setup:

Everything is done on a Raspberry pi 3 in combination with Python and R.
For every match at e certain time there is a cronjob that processes the data and posts it on Twitter. The jobs start two hours and 15 minutes after the match started. As the Raspberry pi only has 1 GB memory, it will take a few minutes before the dashboard is made and posted on Twitter. 

Things to do
- think about improvements for the 22/23 season
